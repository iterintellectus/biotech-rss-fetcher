# Example PDFs Directory

This directory is included as an example for the PDF storage structure. 

When the script downloads PDFs from articles, they will be stored in the parent directory (`pdfs/`). This example directory is kept in the repository to ensure the folder structure is maintained.

The actual PDF files are not stored in the repository as they might be subject to copyright and would increase the repository size unnecessarily.
